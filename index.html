Oneplus 8 Pro</h3><img src="img/196f3ae7349dd5ae86cfa94cd8425f60.jpg" width="100%" class="center" /><p style="box-sizing: inherit; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 25px; margin-left: auto; color: #101010; font-family: proxima-nova, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">image credit : androidcentral.</p><p style="box-sizing: inherit; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 25px; margin-left: auto; color: #101010; font-family: proxima-nova, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">The&nbsp;OnePlus 8 Pro&nbsp;is impressive and well-designed as any high-end smartphone can be. If you know anything about OnePlus phones, you'll be happy to know it doesn't upend the traditional OnePlus formula. Instead, it extends it to its logical place in the world of 2020 flagships with more features and a higher price.</p><p style="box-sizing: inherit; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 25px; margin-left: auto; color: #101010; font-family: proxima-nova, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">The hardware goes toe-to-toe with any phone out there, and it's punctuated by the best display OnePlus has ever used. It's bright, colorful and has a 120Hz refresh rate. Inside, there are exceptional specs, and that leads to fantastic performance thanks to the super-smooth OxygenOS software &mdash; it's just a joy to use.</p><p style="box-sizing: inherit; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 25px; margin-left: auto; color: #101010; font-family: proxima-nova, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">The 8 Pro also brings the best cameras yet to the OnePlus phone, with a new primary sensor that steps up its game to a true flagship level. The entire camera experience is a small step behind the likes of the Galaxy S20+, but then again, it's also a little less expensive. That's really where the 8 Pro fits in. It's a true flagship experience top to bottom, for just a bit less money than the traditional players with big brand names.</p><h3>2. Galaxy S20+</h3><img src="img/b2ed2d883ede060e7e5627cbe31556a9.jpg" width="100%" class="center" /><p><span style="color: #101010; font-family: proxima-nova, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">image credit : androidcentral.</span></p><p><span style="color: #101010; font-family: proxima-nova, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">Before the Galaxy S20 series came out, our top pick here was the Galaxy S10+ &mdash; and everything Samsung did this year made it easy to recommend the&nbsp;</span><a href="#" style="box-sizing: inherit; color: inherit; border-bottom: 1px solid #b7b7b7; font-family: proxima-nova, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; font-weight: 400;">S20+</a><span style="color: #101010; font-family: proxima-nova, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">. The S20+ makes improvements across the board, with a bigger display that has a super-smooth 120Hz refresh rate, a larger 4,500mAh battery, more RAM, and a new Snapdragon 865 processor. Every Galaxy S20+ is 5G capable as well, for all of the U.S. carriers, which isn't the biggest deal right now but will become more critical as we push into 2021.</span></p><p style="box-sizing: inherit; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 25px; margin-left: auto; color: #101010; font-family: proxima-nova, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">The huge move up is with the cameras, with a new array both front and back. The new sensors are all larger and let in more light so you can take&nbsp;<em style="box-sizing: inherit;">dramatically</em>&nbsp;better low-light photos. It's not entirely on the level of the Pixel 4 XL, but this is a big step up for Samsung and is no longer a shortcoming of this flagship. You also get capable zooming up to 5X, while keeping an ultra-wide camera for more shooting variety.</p><p style="box-sizing: inherit; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 25px; margin-left: auto; color: #101010; font-family: proxima-nova, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">The only way the S20+ steps down from the S10+ is in its price and removal of the headphone jack. The base phone is a couple of hundred dollars more than it was last year, and removing the audio jack is a severe blow for those who rely on it or prefer the sound quality. But both are a result of the way the whole industry is going &mdash; phones keep getting more expensive, and Samsung was already one of the last holdouts in the high-end space the keep a 3.5 mm jack.</p><h3>3. Moto G Power</h3><img src="img/cf1315940406335ce86a4947bc478f52.jpg" width="100%" class="center" /><p style="box-sizing: inherit; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 25px; margin-left: auto; color: #101010; font-family: proxima-nova, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">image credit : androidcentral.</p><p style="box-sizing: inherit; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 25px; margin-left: auto; color: #101010; font-family: proxima-nova, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">With no Moto G8 models being sold directly in the U.S. this year, the new Moto G Power fills in that gap by offering a solid Android experience at a fantastic price. The phone stands out in the battery department, offering multi-day endurance. Pair that with great software, fun cameras, and solid specs all around, and the Moto G Power packs quite a punch.</p><p style="box-sizing: inherit; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 25px; margin-left: auto; color: #101010; font-family: proxima-nova, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">That said, lacking NFC and facing Motorola's infamous history with slow software updates could be a reason to think twice before picking one up. However, if you want to save money, you can't beat this price.</p></div></div></div></main></p><br /><br /><footer class="footer"><div class="container"><p>MARKETING DISCLOSURE: This website is a market place.
