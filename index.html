        <h3>Australia Father Of 2 Changed His Entire Life This Way</h3>
        <p>Nio Dollins, an Australian father of 2 and his wife Amelia, Australian residents, married in 2004 after years of dating. His wife worked as a receptionist at a local clinic and Nio was a worker at a construction company.

Three years ago, the company Nio was working for suddenly lost their largest client and had to do layoffs that same day. Unforunately, Nio was part of the group that got laid off.

“I didn’t know what to do that first day – I was embarrassed to tell my wife. We depended on my income to pay bills! I felt like I had failed my family. I needed to find a new job, and fast.” Nio shared.

While searching through job markets, Nio saw an business idea about working from home with basic knowledge of computer. The was like creating website and charging small ammounts as a freelancer.


Nio started doing his work from computer without telling his wife. He created an account on few freelancing websites and after few days he got some good work for small business owners, who wants to take there business online.

He did good work and got some excellent reviews from a lot of small business owners. So he felt happy.

Using the internet to work from computer has become one of the largest worldwide trends now a days. The best part is that you can learn any productive work with just a google search.

Nio was nervous about starting the freelancing. He know the computer pretty well, but he had never done anything like this before and didn’t know much about website creating at all. But he shared : It was very easy to get started. I can even work from my kitchen.”

After his first two weeks doing freelancing, two checks arrived totaling good numbers. Noah decided he needed a way to make more money from freelancing. So, he hired a team of good copy writers and started his own blog.

You must be thinking, where is Nio’s blog ?
